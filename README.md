###### Features
+ Take screenshots of your primary screen.

 ``` csharp
var screencap = new ScreenCapture();  
screencap.OnScreenshotTaken += Screencap_OnScreenshotTaken; // Optional: Subscribe to the event.
screencap.TakeScreenshot();                                 // Optional: Add a filename.
 ```
+ Record your primary screen and save it as gif.  
  Warning: Experimental stage.
 ``` csharp
var screencap = new ScreenCapture();
screencap.AnimationCreator.OnOutOfMemoryExceptionThrown += AnimationCreator_OnOutOfMemoryExceptionThrown;
screencap.OnAnimationCreated += Screencap_OnAnimationCreated;   // Optional: Subscribe to the events.
screencap.CreateGIF(50, 100);                                   // Will record 50 frames, 10 per second.
 ```

+ Multimonitor support.  
  Warning: Only tested with 2 screens, but it should work with more aswell.
 ``` csharp
using System.Windows.Forms;

// Default screen is your Primary Screen!
var screencap = new ScreenCapture();
Screen[] myScreens = screencap.AllScreens;
// Check the array for the screen you want to capture.
// Then paste it into:
screencap.ChangeScreen(myScreens[1]);   // myScreens[1] is my second screen.
 ```

+ Selectable screenregion.  
  If you use this you wonÂ´t have to set your screen.
 ``` csharp
using System.Drawing;

var screencap = new ScreenCapture();
screencap.ScreenRegion.UpperLeftCorner = new Point(100, 100);
// or
screencap.ScreenRegion.SetLowerRightCorner(); // Will set the Point to the current mouse position.
 ```
